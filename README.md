# INI_Editor
INI_Editor is a simple C++ GUI program that lets you open and edit INI configuration files. 

It is written in C++ and it's open-source, so it can be modified by anyone using QtCreator or CLion.

It features inheritance from abstract class, polymorphism, late binding, error checking and exceptions, static methods, templates, and STL like data structures (using Qt libraries).

It is also possible to use Qt Unit Testing to test "save file", "load file", and "edit table" functions, and also the catching of "invalid row exception", (only available in QtCreator).
